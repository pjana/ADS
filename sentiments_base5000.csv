Sign me up.  We were seated, next to a screaming baby might I add, inside, even though we requested the patio.  We asked our server to be moved to the patio.We moved to the patio, where our new server tells us the special: half off lettuce wraps, which was advertised on the board as the next day's special.

Brewstone Beer Company was one of those dynamite experiences that just put smiles on our faces.  An extremely large location with about four main dining areas and multiple bars, Brewstone not only serves up their own blends of house-brewed ale; but offers an array of mind-blowing food!  Right off the bat I was thrilled when they nailed my signature drink, The Brimstone Red - sweet and perfect!  Then they brought out this inconceivable platter of their Brewstone Signature Nachos that was utterly astonishing... never before have I been this floored with the MASSIVE size and flavor behavior of... well - Nachos.  Big enough for a hungry couple or a group, it was off the chain with tri-colored tortilla chips, fresh avocado, jack and cheddar cheese, house chili... should I go on?  We opted for all three meats: grilled chicken, steak and BBQ pulled pork to top our serving.  It came out piled-high with large chunks of chicken that had intense flavor and was moist, juicy and delish.  LOVED the sweet and tangy, smoky BBQ pork that was off the charts - total fan.  As for the steak... sweet and unbelievable!  Best nachos EVER in Food Hound history to date.The Seared Ahi Tuna again blew my mind... Sashimi grade Ahi Tuna coated with black and white sesame seeds; the presentation was enticing - thick and meaty slices, cool and refreshing, fresh and fantasmic!  I thoroughly enjoyed their wasabi mousse - sweet and spicy with flavor that just makes you want more - WIN!  The Chicken Lettuce Wraps were simple and divine; lettuce, chicken, wontons and carrots with a BOSS ginger soy sauce that enhances the taste of the whole shebang.  Something new that we've never experienced before was the Tri-Colored Cheese Sticks - the BIG difference is the use of cheddar as opposed to the typical mozzarella; but aside from the obvious... they utilize crushed tri-color tortilla chips in the batter used to coat the cheese before frying!  So fantastic and unique - they are paired with a spicy marinara and crispy onion straws for good measure.  Of course we had to try the Mac & Cheese - a hefty helping of over four cheeses co-mingling with penne, then topped with big chunks of luscious chicken to create a hot, steamy mini-meal (make sure every bite has some chicken).  The Corn Chowder had a chunky consistency of potatoes and corn with just a hint of seasoning with a bit of a kick to pop your taste buds.The entrees cometh... we enjoyed a Tex-Mex Sandwich which was an overwhelming roller coaster of zesty flavor - juicy chicken offers an even keel on this sandwich; the pepper jack and jalapeno gives a spicy kick that is counteracted by the avocado adding a fresh cooling effect. The Shrimp Alfredo's flavor is ka-pow... big, juicy shrimp doused in an intense alfredo sauce - a hefty serving for a hungry critter!  Another big deal at Brewstone is their signature pizza - the Meatball Pizza was a solid and delicious pie; the meatballs were large, chunky and offered a great rendition of an old classic.  I almost passed out after the first bite of the Pulled Pork BBQ Pizza as it was orgasmic!  Sweet, smoky and explosive - stacked with fresh corn, their unreal pulled BBQ pork and delectable caramelized onions... full of cheese with a killer flavor.  Beautiful, bountiful... absurdly GREAT!  Lastly, the Chicken Madeira was like eating a Thanksgiving dinner; but with chicken- creamy mashed potatoes and saut̩ed green beans that were juicy, fresh and crunchy!  The chicken itself was tender and tucked into the plate with a thick blanket of mozzarella cheese and then drowned in heavenly gravy.

Then I squinted through the rain, looked closer and saw that the place that closed shop was actually called ""Islands Tast"" (That is not my typo) and that I was actually a block from my real destination.

The rice orders comes as either small or large, the large being about $2 more per order.  Thinking that I wanted try more then one selection here, I chose two small orders, assuming it'll be tiny enough to manage. My thought when my orders came was, ""Damn if that is the small size, I can't imagine the big one.""  The portion size was generous. There was no Homemade Ginger Beer that was very disappointing, and no Cabbage on this Tuesday evening. My orders:Jerk Chicken.  This dish must be filled with crack.  It's so moist, juicy, flavorful, and surprisingly had a decent spicy kick to it.  The meat was of the fall of the bone variety and the skin was peppery, well spiced, and slightly soft but not soggy.  The rice with beans that I chose with this order was just as good.The beans infuses the incredibly  soft rice with it's flavor and gives it a slightly sweet taste.  Not that I know what crack is like mind you.  No.. really.  I just assumed that it's like eating this dish. Once I start, I can't stop. Help me... I think it's my new addiction.....  One of the best Jerk Chicken I've had in Pittsburgh.Curry Goat with a side of salad.  It's pretty tasty if you could get past the gamy taste of this particular type of meat.  The chunks of goat meat were tender if a bit chewy, and pieces of it came with the bones still attached.  The rice this time was infused with the non spicy green curry sauce that smothered the whole dish.  The side salad came in it's own small Styrofoam container.  I was expecting a typical bland salad but this pleasantly surprised me.  The salad was drenched in a light semi sweet dressing and consists of (from my memory) leafy greens, raisins, red peppers, yellow peppers, cucumbers, onions and probably one or two ingredients I don't recall.  I would happily order the larger version of this from the menu if I had to.I took everything to go.   Luckily, this place is located across the street from  In warmer weather, I suggest taking it to go and eating it nearby.I think I could understand why that other Jamaican Restaurant had to close down.  It's hard to imagine staying in business with a rival that makes food as fantastic as this place only a mere block away.  Especially  with that Crack Chic... I mean Jerk  Chicken.************************************************** **",review,1,Br_Smhj4sBAwXDm5G-a8tg,,"On a rainy evening, while in search of this little place, I passed by a shuttered restaurant and saw the dimly lit words "" Royal Caribbean"" and ""Jamaican"" and went NOOOOOOOO!!!!!

It's so moist, juicy, flavorful, and surprisingly had a decent spicy kick to it.  The meat was of the fall of the bone variety and the skin was peppery, well spiced, and slightly soft but not soggy.  The rice with beans that I chose with this order was just as good.The beans infuses the incredibly  soft rice with it's flavor and gives it a slightly sweet taste.  Not that I know what crack is like mind you.  No.. really.  I just assumed that it's like eating this dish. Once I start, I can't stop. Help me... I think it's my new addiction.....  One of the best Jerk Chicken I've had in Pittsburgh.Curry Goat with a side of salad.  It's pretty tasty if you could get past the gamy taste of this particular type of meat.  The chunks of goat meat were tender if a bit chewy, and pieces of it came with the bones still attached.  The rice this time was infused with the non spicy green curry sauce that smothered the whole dish.  The side salad came in it's own small Styrofoam container.  I was expecting a typical bland salad but this pleasantly surprised me.  The salad was drenched in a light semi sweet dressing and consists of (from my memory) leafy greens, raisins, red peppers, yellow peppers, cucumbers, onions and probably one or two ingredients I don't recall.  I would happily order the larger version of this from the menu if I had to.I took everything to go.   Luckily, this place is located across the street from  In warmer weather, I suggest taking it to go and eating it nearby.I think I could understand why that other Jamaican Restaurant had to close down.  It's hard to imagine staying in business with a rival that makes food as fantastic as this place only a mere block away.  Especially  with that Crack Chic... I mean Jerk  Chicken.************************************************** **",0,0,1,0

It is that place, the place one wants to dine for simple, fried but not greasy, inexpensive, seafood.I ordered the Shore Dinner, Fried ( Includes Fish, Crab Cakes, Fries & Slaw). I was not in-love with the crab cakes. This is not to say they were not enjoyable, I've just had better. Heck, for the price I don't want to sound like I am complaining they fit the crab craving for the price range extremely well! The fried foods did not taste like grease and they obviously either recently or frequently change the oil as no icky after taste could be found. We also ordered the fried shrimp and an order of fried mushrooms. Yum! One worries when ordering fried foods especially seafood, about it been overcook. This was not the case here. Keep in mind the breading is not to die for- this is not Monterey Bay Fish Grotto . That being sad, it fit the bill for affordable, seafood, and a quick meal.I was impressed with their soups.

It is that place, the place one wants to dine for simple, fried but not greasy, inexpensive, seafood.I ordered the Shore Dinner, Fried ( Includes Fish, Crab Cakes, Fries & Slaw). I was not in-love with the crab cakes. This is not to say they were not enjoyable, I've just had better. Heck, for the price I don't want to sound like I am complaining they fit the crab craving for the price range extremely well! The fried foods did not taste like grease and they obviously either recently or frequently change the oil as no icky after taste could be found. We also ordered the fried shrimp and an order of fried mushrooms. Yum! One worries when ordering fried foods especially seafood, about it been overcook. This was not the case here. Keep in mind the breading is not to die for- this is not Monterey Bay Fish Grotto . That being sad, it fit the bill for affordable, seafood, and a quick meal.I was impressed with their soups.

One recommendation she made that I really appreciated was that if we wanted salads, to split one instead of each ordering our own.  We split a casear salad, which was still big as a half size.

But if you walk a tiny bit, you'll get to the Grand Concourse, which is so much better, with similar views and prices.Also, it took us about 25 minutes between asking for the check and actually getting it.  And like I said, the place wasn't busy.  There were maybe five tables and two waitresses.  I just don't get it.The more that I think about it, I might go back, if it was a pretty night, just to have that potato pancake again.  But just for that potato pancake ;)",0.2263,0.241,0.759,0

The girlfriend, J, and I checked into the hotel after a long ordeal at the Pittsburgh airport and we were both excited to try this steakhouse that everyone between Pittsburgh International and the front desk raved about. Hey we like steak and it seemed to be just what we needed to feel normal again. It was only 7:30 PM when we walked to the restaurant but there was no one there. Were they open? Is there another place where we should look for a host or hostess? Eventually a waitress strolled out from what we assumed was the kitchen area and asked us if we needed help. We asked if they were open and she gave us a funny look. Not backing down we starred at her until she admitted they were. We were allowed to choose our own seat and since there were no other diners to give us any competition we chose a window seat that gave us a view of the Monongahela River. The waitress/hostess handed us menus and I requested the wine list. ""It's on the table."", was her response. Oh, how silly of me not to realize the laminated card that had the happy hour drink specials was also the wine list. Who was running this operation, Chili's? As soon as the waitress was out of earshot I whispered to J, ""Order something different from me because that lady is definitely going to spit in my food."" If memory serves me correctly there was a bottle of Opus One on the wine laminant for $300 or so and then all of the other bottles were less than $35. Talk about two extremes. I did a little restaurant math and figured the Opus One was for the poor business traveler that was booked into this horrible hotel and wanted to exact revenge on his or her company by abusing his or her expense account privileges. Call me crazy but this didn't appear to be the type of restaurant that had proper cellar facilities for a wine the caliber of Opus One so it was eliminated right away from our vino option. The other wines were a little foreign to us as well. I knew the varietals but some of the appellations were new to me. The state of Pennsylvania is part of four American Viticulture Areas (a fact I learned after I returned home) and as much as I am up for trying new and unusual wine I was leaning towards the token offering from the southern hemisphere. The waitress returned to see if we had any questions about the menu. I asked what she thought of the Shiraz. She then gave me the same look I received when I asked if they were open. Not wanting to go through another starring contest I quickly pointed to the wine laminant and humbly said, ""This one. I might not be pronouncing it correctly."" (I was). ""Oh, it's lovely and one of our best sellers."" Well at least if it sold well we reduced our risk of it being an old bottle that had already turned into vinegar. ""We'll take one of those please."" We still had high hopes for the steaks. J ordered the filet and I ordered the rib-eye. The waitress explained to us that Pittsburgh rare is a method of cooking the steak where it is flash seared and charred on the outside and blood red rare on the inside. I decided to try Pittsburgh Rare because how bad can it be if they went to the trouble of naming the restaurant after the cooking method, right? I even went for the off the menu topping of caramelized onions and reduce balsamic vinegar as my topping. For my side I chose the mac & cheese. The steak was good, in fact it was very good and I was happy with the Pittsburgh Rare preparation. Sure it was a little bloody and turned my mac & cheese a pink color that J called disturbing, but it tasted great. Even the wine wasn't as bad as I expected and as far as I can tell my entree was loogie free. We skipped dessert but they brought us out what J and I called a seafoam-colored cloud of cotton candy. This was by far the best cotton candy I have ever had. The only way I can describe it is to imagine the flavor of green Lifesavers in the cotton candy format. It was the highlight of the weekend. Would I recommend Pittsburgh Rare? Yes.

They live within walking distance of my home, so it's no problem getting here and the temptation for sushi is always in the back of my mind! Admittedly, the price of the food here tends to keep my cravings in check for a couple months at a time, but when I do come here, I enjoy every bite. Occasionally I also order take-out since they have very reasonable lunch deals, but really, I prefer to sit and eat at the restaurant itself.Speaking of: the place itself is very quiet, which I actually like; I can just sit, talk with a friend or read a book, and then (what a radical concept) enjoy my food in peace. This is a big deal for me because the other places I know of where I can get sushi are loud, busy, and quite frankly, a little limiting options-wise compared to Sushi Three's menu. If I want sushi, I either come here or I get a small pack at Giant Eagle. That's how much I dislike eating in the other sushi places I've visited in Pittsburgh to date (although with more and more places opening this opinion may change soon!). If I'm going to pay as much as I do for my fish, I want to be in a place I can sit and actually enjoy my food.By the way, Sushi Three does serve things other than sushi, so people looking for some Japanese food that isn't rice and fish are definitely going to find something. There's some really delicious beef, chicken and pork dishes (one family member of mine absolutely adores their pork katsudon). But of course, a place with the word ""sushi"" in its name is going to specialize in sushi, and there are pages and pages of sushi options available here. The orders come in various styles and sizes as well, so couples can get something to share or just get something smaller for themselves. The combos all come with soup and salad, which are also very yummy. My personal routine order as of today is a large salad and an order of softshell crab rolls.

As far as piercings go.I called Sinners and Saints inquiring about a naval piercing, the cost ($45), and if the piercer was in the shop that day (I was told he was). When I arrived there, the piercing guy wasn't even there. I overheard the employees asking each other if they've heard from him because he wasn't responding to their calls/text. I was there with a friend and when the piercer finally shows up about 10-15 mins later, he doesn't greet us, or even look at us. One of the employees came out to tell me the piercing guy was setting up in the back and gave me a form to fill out. While filling out the form, the piercer came out and asked if I wanted a barbell or a hoop, I told him a barbell. After that he looked as if he was going to say something in relation to my options, but then he just said ""Ok"" and went to the back. Finally, my friend and I went to the back, and the piercer had a mean look on his face, he seemed as if he just wanted to get me over with. He told me to put my belongings on a chair. While doing that, I asked if clients can choose what gauge they would like in their naval or is their a standard size and he said a 14 gauge is the only size that can go as a naval piercing. While keeping a fair distance, my friend came over to watch (no video recording was being done, as I know many people do this). The piercer pointed to my friend and said ""No, you stand back there"" (which was practically out of the room) then he pointed to me and said ""You come over here"". I felt like we were being treated like bad dogs. He lifted my shirt up, roughly cleaned my naval area, told me to sit on the edge of the chair and lean back. While still having no real conversation and being rough with me, he proceeded. While getting pierced, he didn't count or tell me to take a deep breath, he just pierced it! After the piercing process was over I thanked him, he told me how long it might take to heal & to use soap and water. Then he said ""Ok, you can pay me now. It'll be $55"" I said ""I thought it was $45..?"" He said it was an extra $10 for the barbell. Wether the barbell was truly an extra $10 or not, he could've told me when he gave me the option to choose between the barbell and the hoop, as I wasn't expecting to pay no more than what I was told, besides the tip. Anyway, I gave him $60, while he was slowly digging in his pockets to give my change back, I just told him to keep it. I thanked him once more and he handed me a care sheet and I left. I examined my new piercing while at home and it seems to be slightly crooked and too far back in my naval hole if that makes sense. From this experience, I don't plan on ever going back here. I actually went to him about 2-3 yrs ago to get a cartilage piercing (which he gave me a 14 gauge also that I did not want) and he was the same way. I went back this time thinking there would be new people, but obviously there wasn't. I also have a relative that experienced the same things as myself, and was not completely satisfied with the results of their piercing. I feel as though I was blackmailed and treated with no respect, and for what it cost, being that I know of other places much cheaper with very friendly, experienced and professional people, it wasn't worth it at all.

First the prices are higher and the seating is more sparse so it's hard to find a seat.  They completely redid the atmosphere so it's less cozy now with more of a sterile stark feeling, and they took the fireplace away, which I don't understand why :(  I used to love going to work in that area.  Peet's also has far fewer food options than Caribou.  I used to love Caribou's breakfast sandwiches but now all they have is pastries or oatmeal, similar to the Starbuck's offerings across the street.  The coffee is overpriced and not that good.  They had some fun Winter varieties but you can go to Starbucks for that for the same prices.  I prefer black coffee and that was definitely superior at Caribou.  Also their iced coffee is awful.  Caribou did a cold press which was delicious and flavorful, but Peet's just chills old stale coffee.  Not happy at all about this change, especially since I'm not a fan of Starbucks and now those are the only two options around that part of Oakland :(UPDATE:You'll note that the owner commented below and I responded to that email as they requested, but never received a response! Seems to be just for show. I was hoping to add more stars to this review over time, but I've continued to have problems on other visits there with them being out of things.  Recently THEIR ESPRESSO MACHINE WAS BROKEN FOR DAYS!.  Seriously, how can you run a coffee shop that focuses on espresso drinks and have it be broken for days??!

First the prices are higher and the seating is more sparse so it's hard to find a seat.  They completely redid the atmosphere so it's less cozy now with more of a sterile stark feeling, and they took the fireplace away, which I don't understand why :(  I used to love going to work in that area.  Peet's also has far fewer food options than Caribou.  I used to love Caribou's breakfast sandwiches but now all they have is pastries or oatmeal, similar to the Starbuck's offerings across the street.  The coffee is overpriced and not that good.  They had some fun Winter varieties but you can go to Starbucks for that for the same prices.  I prefer black coffee and that was definitely superior at Caribou.  Also their iced coffee is awful.  Caribou did a cold press which was delicious and flavorful, but Peet's just chills old stale coffee.  Not happy at all about this change, especially since I'm not a fan of Starbucks and now those are the only two options around that part of Oakland :(UPDATE:You'll note that the owner commented below and I responded to that email as they requested, but never received a response! Seems to be just for show. I was hoping to add more stars to this review over time, but I've continued to have problems on other visits there with them being out of things.  Recently THEIR ESPRESSO MACHINE WAS BROKEN FOR DAYS!.  Seriously, how can you run a coffee shop that focuses on espresso drinks and have it be broken for days??!

When you walk in, you're greeted by a dart board- just the thing to walk into the path of. The place is dingy with no real style. There's a long bar on the right as you walk in, and a strange area of booths on the left. Then, the restaurant opens into a large room with tables and more awkwardly placed booths and a stage for bands. In that area, there is a set of a few stairs and a hole cut into the wall that i think led to more tables, but I didn't go up there- it looked all lit up and decorated completely different from the rest of the place. It was almost like the restaurant (if you can call this glorified bar a restaurant) expanded, but each time someone different decorated that area. Plus, the bathrooms were scary, and I couldn't figure out where the kitchen was (where was the food coming from???).The beer selection was average- mainstream beers and a few craft choices- and the prices were okay.

Not much parking out front, but some in the rear I believe.  Love the nostalgic decor inside of the classic cars and such.  Has a little corner dedicated to Marilyn Monroe and Elvis.  Often a senior citizen hangout.  I haven't had their donuts before, but they gave a free one once to my girlfriend's daughter.  Thumbs up to this family owned establishment!

Whenever we heard about Davio I was surprised to find out that it was located in Beechview as it wouldn't have been my first place to put an expensive Italian restaurant but it seems to work here.  Whenever we walked into the restaurant I was reminded of an old house with fancy tables covered in white table cloths, knick-knacks all over the place and then the painting from their website.  I am not really sure what is up with that picture but I personally found it rather creepy but that is my own opinion. We were also seated in full view of a table from which I was assuming the owner conducted his business?  Throughout dinner he was making phone calls and many of the waitresses stopped back to talk to him.  I thought that was a little weird and all but it didn't negatively affect our dining experience.One of the first things that they do whenever you arrive here is bring you out some homemade bread along with 3 different dipping sauces.  The bread was excellent, especially with the white bean sauce which I loved.  There was also a wonderful olive oil with lemon juice and Parmesan cheese and finally and olive tapenade type sauce.  For our appetizer we decided to go with the Calamari and jumbo shrimp which was saut̩ed with spinach and ripe olives in unfiltered olive oil with garlic.  They were not joking around whenever they said jumbo shrimp either as they were some of the biggest shrimp I have ever eaten and tasted good too.  The calamari was also pretty good, cooked nicely so that it was tender and not too chewy.  For my entree I had the NY  Sirloin  Strip  Steak  which was described on the menu as a generously hand-cut, seasoned with olive oil and cracked black pepper to create an intensely flavorful steak.  Once again generously hand cut was an understatement as my steak was humongous.  The seasoning on it was perfect as well and it was tender leading to a very enjoyable entree.  It was so large and combined with the rest of the food that we had eaten so filling that I actually ended up taking about half of it home.  I honestly can not say the last time that I had a hard time finishing my meal.The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.

The server then takes your order and flutters off to get this salad that would take great effort to duplicate at home. It is not big but has no less then 20 ingredients. To list them all would be stupid but there is pine nuts, artichoke, roasted red pepper etc. Then at just the perfect moment the meal that you chose is served to you and it takes a moment to realize how perfect it is. The smell is amazingly fresh and the food is just cooked perfect. I have been a professional chef in many settings from corporate banquet to personal and I don't think that I have ever cooked anything that tasted this good.  This small restaurant in Beechview on a street shared by the T is what people thinking about moving to this city need to experience.",0.34,0.103,0.897,0

I read a very nice review of this place on Pittsburgh Live (http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/lifestyles/fooddrink/s_619820.html), but now am skeptical of the reviewers motives. The review made this place sound like it was a hip new addition to the Pittsburgh food scene, but really it's more like a not so hip new addition to the tired old ideas executed poorly scene (okay, that was lame). But seriously, for the price and the hype, I was expecting a lot more. So let's begin with the decor. You walk in and things seem nice and posh. Dark lighting, classy tables and chairs...the works. But then you start looking at the art and it's of various sports? I get that we live in a sports centered city, but now I just think that Melange is a glorified sports bar, not a classy eatery. And if it's a sports bar, how can they justify charging ~$30-40/person? So perhaps they need to think about their identity a bit.Next, we move on to the service, which, for the most, part was okay, but given that we were the ONLY party in the restaurant, wasn't exactly stellar. Our waiter was very nice and made no substantial mistakes, but when I asked for a wine recommendation (they have three Malbecs...which I tend to love), he named something else all together (thinking that it was a Malbec) and then back peddled when he realized that I saw he was making it up as he went along. He recommended a good wine, but my experience is that those are all good, so really the credit does not go to him. Then, when our main dishes came out (4 of which were meat dishes) he forgot to bring our steak knives. Again, wouldn't have been a problem, but our butter knives were covered in...well...butter. So probably not a good idea to reuse them. Then, it turned out that they only had 2 clean steak knives in the entire place. Really? Again, keep in mind that we were the only people there and it was 7:30pm...not exactly right after opening. So yah, service was so-so.Finally, the pi̬ce de r̩sistance, the food (please note the sarcasm). A few us ordered the chili lime quesadillas (which sounded great...see photo), but the chef apparently forgot the chili and the lime. They were as bland as anything I've eaten in a long time. On to the main dish. I ordered pork tenderloin (see photo) which was actually not too bad. The sauce was sweet (I like that) and the meat was cooked just right. So, on that front, well done. But my girlfriend ordered the lamb (the most expensive dish on the menu) and it was completely boring...and a little cold. I usually love to pick at food on her plate, but this time I had no such inclination. Sorry love, but that one is all yours :-pSome of the other dishes were okay, but not great. A friend got the walnut salad and said it was tasty. Another friend got the wasabi popcorn and enjoyed it as well. So I can't say that ALL the food was bad, but the majority was.

I was encouraged when we walked in and saw individual TVs on each table.  Of course we picked the one that didn't work!  Then we realized while there were many out of market games, the Virginia Tech one was nowhere to be seen. So we politely ask for ESPN.  Not ESPN U or 360 or anything fancy.  Plain old regular ESPN.  Then we get some story about how they only have six recievers.  Thats fine.  But why am i watching the Maine/Iowa game.  SERIOUSLY.  I was also annoyed that when the cute girl walked up to the bar, he had the Georgia game on within minutes. The nachos were absolutely disgusting and my wrap just leaked oil and disgustingness.   The fries were even terrible, but i found if you dipped them in the gross nacho cheese, they weren' that bad.   Plus, beer was 4.75!  Multiply that by a 3 hour game and you're paying a lot.  Service was awful and i think i would get better reception on a tv with rabbit ears.  Overall this place sucked, although i will give them credit as we were finally getting up to leave and go to an Irish Bar that was able to show ESPN, i noticed the hokie game all the way back in the corner.  Took them long enough.If you're ever in Pittsburgh in need of watching ESPN heres my idea.

Many people like to go there for drinks, but one of the things I really enjoyed was their restaurant.  I used to tell people that I never had anything I did not like at Magoo's.  But alas, that has changed. A few months ago they let the bar manager go.  I was disappointed because I thought he brought a lot of class to the place.  He would greet customers personally, was knowledgeable about the beers and spirits that were available and ensured that service was prompt and pleasant.  He always offered good suggestions of new things to try and organized promotions that would make an evening out a little more interesting.  The beer tasting seminars they did a couple years ago first piqued my interest and got me going to Magoo's regularly.  The recent change in bar staff coupled changes in my routine lead me to go there less and less.  The bar felt less welcoming to me, but I chalked that up to my comfort with the old staff.When I first ate at Magoo's, I found the food extremely good and soon found myself having dinner there regularly.  When my mother or friends from out of town would visit, I would feel confident taking them to Magoo's knowing I could expect good service and a delicious meal.  Over the last several weeks, I have noticed that the flavor of the food seemed less than what I was accustomed to.  Last week, I was severed a chicken strip appetizer that was inedible.  Then last night I ordered the special, Chicken Pot Pie.  Chicken Pot Pie has been a staple on the menu at Magoo's since I first started going there and it has always been a hearty, tasty, well prepared dish.  Last night I was severed a dish whose contents were too hot to eat even after sitting for an extended period of time.  The crust was so rubbery I could not eat it with a fork, instead I had to cut it with my knife, but it was the only part of the dish I could put in my mouth without raising blisters on my tongue.  The dish was obviously overly prepared in a microwave not baked when I ordered it.  The waitress noticed I was not eating my meal and was very concerned, insisting upon bringing me something else to eat. I opted for the Blackened Salmon dish my son had ordered.  It was better, but still not to the level I have come to expect; passable but unimpressive.  I found out that the former head chef has moved from the area and that the owners are attempting to make the kitchen more profitable by changing some of the ingredients.  It shows.

Clean, beautiful tin ceilings, and comfortable.  The service on the other hand was atrocious.  We sat at the bar and there were two other patrons.  After my bf finished his beer the bartended threw away the bottle then proceeded to ignore us for fifteen minutes while serving everyone else there multiple times.

We received some coupons in the mail for $10 off a $20 purchase. Its a pretty rad coupon. I'm apparently not the only one who thought so because both times we checked this place out, there were lines out the door. The first time we were busy and didn't have the time to sit and wait. The second time, we waited in an even longer line. It was obvious the staff was only letting so many shoppers in at a time. Even though this was obvious, every other yinzer trying to push a cart into the store demanded to know what was the matter. Still, the wait was maybe 10 minutes tops. No big deal.You will see me comparing this store to both Walmart and to Aldi's. And unfortunately, it doesn't really measure up to either. Its prices are generally higher than Aldi's on most items. Prices are about even with Walmart, with a greater selection at Walmart. Basically, Bottom Dollar is a cross between an Aldi's and a normal grocery store. Actually its more like a regular grocery store that's just smaller and uses cartons and crates to display the items instead of traditional shelving. In all honestly, its not really like Aldi's at all.Well the first thing we noticed was the produce section. We were assuming it would be like Aldi's, where you can only by prepackaged bundles of produce at super low prices. Here, the prices are generally very low but you get to bag your own stuff. Most of the produce is in a cold room. Reading online this is because it saves on labor from having to push the produce into and out of the cooler each night. Most of the prices were about what they'd be at Walmart. Some were actually more expensive but most were probably a dime cheaper per pound.Other than that, its pretty much a normal grocery store. The prices are cheap, but they're not THAT cheap. Most of the prices are right in line with Walmart. Some are slightly more expensive and some are less so. There's no deli or bakery or anything. The only real steal I found was a 5 pound package of drumsticks for like 2 bucks. Its whats for supper tonight. Other than that, I could have gotten everything else at Walmart for the same price.

I enjoy that they place all the snacks and junk in the front of the store because that means ill usually pass them up on my way to get the items i really need. The milk cheese and butter products are all against the back wall. The have half an aisle for fruits and vegetables. It's just a small amount so nothing to exotic like mangoes or avocados. Just your run of the mill apples, pears, bananas, green peppers, potato, onions...things like that. Most of the food is knock off name brand but it doesn't taste as bad as some other knock offs. I enjoy their cheese and bread products. Plus the frozen meat section is good as well.I always shop here for my freezer and storage bags as they are alot cheaper than hefty or glad brand but they work just as well. The store usually isn't crowded until about 4 to 6, those are the usual just getting off work hours. They charge you for the shopping carts and bags though. That's the only downside. you put a quarter in to get the shopping carts and after you return the cart you receive the quarter back. It's like a deposit of sorts. The paper bags are 5 cents and the plastic ones are 10 cents. I guess they charge for the bags because the groceries themselves are so cheap. Plus, after a while of spending money on bags you start to bring your own. It's a good way to recycle too. I tend to empty on of the chip boxes as soon as i walk in. This helps me avoid paying for the extra bags.One of the best things about ALdi's is that it caters to the life of a single person as well as to a couple or a small family. I can just run in grab what i need without worrying about longlines or being bombarded with one thousand options. I don't like to waste alot of time in the grocery store especially if i just need some milk or napkins so Aldi's helps me to get in and out with little fuss.

If you're heading out with a group of friends be sure to contact SBAR ahead of time to book a free ""happy hour"" party from 9-11pm. I have booked several of these in the last few months because my friends love them. The party gets you free cover, drink specials, and even free champagne. The bartenders are excellent and wait time for a drink is minimal regardless of the crowd. A shot girl walks around selling shots that actually have alcohol in them compared to the kool aid shots you will get elsewhere in southside. There's a coat check in the winter, so ladies no need to freeze in the frigid weather. It gets pretty crowded around 11:30 or midnight on Fridays and Saturdays but the dance floor is a blast.  They have some of the best DJs in pittsburgh. The bar side is a little more relaxed and offers a few places to sit and enjoy your drink. Warning: there is a dress code. No hats, no timbs or work boots. It's a slightly more upscale bar/night club in southside so dress accordingly. The crowd is usually diverse.

It's a great place to celebrate birthdays, bachelor parties, and bachelorette parties with top of the line VIP bottle service. If you're heading out with a group of friends be sure to contact SBAR ahead of time to book a free ""happy hour"" party from 9-11pm. I have booked several of these in the last few months because my friends love them. The party gets you free cover, drink specials, and even free champagne. The bartenders are excellent and wait time for a drink is minimal regardless of the crowd. A shot girl walks around selling shots that actually have alcohol in them compared to the kool aid shots you will get elsewhere in southside. There's a coat check in the winter, so ladies no need to freeze in the frigid weather. It gets pretty crowded around 11:30 or midnight on Fridays and Saturdays but the dance floor is a blast.  They have some of the best DJs in pittsburgh. The bar side is a little more relaxed and offers a few places to sit and enjoy your drink. Warning: there is a dress code. No hats, no timbs or work boots. It's a slightly more upscale bar/night club in southside so dress accordingly. The crowd is usually diverse.

It's a farm to table restaurant so the ingredients are all extremely fresh, with many herbs being grown on site.We arrived late on a Friday night and the first thing we noticed: It was loud - there was a DJ in the bar that you could hear very well from behind several brick walls.. But as it's the first week, I'm sure they realize the issue and we'll be the only ones fortunate enough to experience that. That being said, our plans of sitting in the bar fell through for hopes of saving our heads and ears from damage, so we opted to sit in the restaurant. The restaurant space is cozy, tons of exposed brick and a large wine rack on display with perfectly sized tables for both casual and intimate conversation. For being so new, the service was excellent.There are two distinct menus, and options from one are not available at the other. First, we decided on drinks - forgoing the wine menu in favor of cocktails - the Ultra L and Banana & Basil(Unfortunately the Cream Soda wasn't quite worked out yet). The Ultra L($9) was extremely delicious - mint, chocolate, and lemon all combined in a smooth and creamy drink. The banana and basil($8) tasted like a banana popsicle, but not quite as sweet. I was excited for the food to arrive, I was just talking to someone about how I had always wanted to try Alla Famiglia and here was a production by the same owners. For our meal we decided to split two menu items - the Caprese salad with fresh-in-house-pulled mozzarella($13) and mushroom risotto sans snails(They were very accommodating to vegetarianism: $15 - $18 w/ snails). The Caprese was ultra-fresh, with heirloom tomatoes, balsamic, olives, and super fresh basil. The risotto had a strong earthy flavor, perfect tenderness, and a delicious hint of black pepper. As someone who doesn't eat mushrooms, I was happy to eat a ton of this dish.I'm not typically one to get dessert, but the waitress was able to tempt us with a mascarpone cheesecake with peach coulis and a graham cracker crust, and I'm glad she did. This dessert was absolutely fantastic, light(for cheesecake) and the peach coulis added the perfect balance to the dish. Definitely one of the highest points of the meal.After dessert we got a glass of wine($9) and another cocktail, the Cocoa Powder($9) - which tasted like a mexican hot chocolate with a ton of cayenne thrown in. This drink was extremely spicy, so look out, but it was never unpleasant. That being said, I really enjoy and eat a lot of spicy food, so your mileage my vary.We were checked on by the bartender and chefs and we thanked them for the wonderful meal. They let us know that in the future there will be two more sections to the restaurant: A beautiful lounge/dance bar upstairs with world-inspired shots instead of cocktails and a beach patio in the back. All in all I'm extremely excited to have this new option in the Strip.

But as it's the first week, I'm sure they realize the issue and we'll be the only ones fortunate enough to experience that. That being said, our plans of sitting in the bar fell through for hopes of saving our heads and ears from damage, so we opted to sit in the restaurant. The restaurant space is cozy, tons of exposed brick and a large wine rack on display with perfectly sized tables for both casual and intimate conversation. For being so new, the service was excellent.There are two distinct menus, and options from one are not available at the other. First, we decided on drinks - forgoing the wine menu in favor of cocktails - the Ultra L and Banana & Basil(Unfortunately the Cream Soda wasn't quite worked out yet). The Ultra L($9) was extremely delicious - mint, chocolate, and lemon all combined in a smooth and creamy drink. The banana and basil($8) tasted like a banana popsicle, but not quite as sweet. I was excited for the food to arrive, I was just talking to someone about how I had always wanted to try Alla Famiglia and here was a production by the same owners. For our meal we decided to split two menu items - the Caprese salad with fresh-in-house-pulled mozzarella($13) and mushroom risotto sans snails(They were very accommodating to vegetarianism: $15 - $18 w/ snails). The Caprese was ultra-fresh, with heirloom tomatoes, balsamic, olives, and super fresh basil. The risotto had a strong earthy flavor, perfect tenderness, and a delicious hint of black pepper. As someone who doesn't eat mushrooms, I was happy to eat a ton of this dish.I'm not typically one to get dessert, but the waitress was able to tempt us with a mascarpone cheesecake with peach coulis and a graham cracker crust, and I'm glad she did. This dessert was absolutely fantastic, light(for cheesecake) and the peach coulis added the perfect balance to the dish. Definitely one of the highest points of the meal.After dessert we got a glass of wine($9) and another cocktail, the Cocoa Powder($9) - which tasted like a mexican hot chocolate with a ton of cayenne thrown in. This drink was extremely spicy, so look out, but it was never unpleasant. That being said, I really enjoy and eat a lot of spicy food, so your mileage my vary.We were checked on by the bartender and chefs and we thanked them for the wonderful meal. They let us know that in the future there will be two more sections to the restaurant: A beautiful lounge/dance bar upstairs with world-inspired shots instead of cocktails and a beach patio in the back. All in all I'm extremely excited to have this new option in the Strip. For a nice Italian dinner(Something I don't usually go with) or a trendy bar, definitely make sure Emilia Romagna is on your radar - especially before there is a line around the block to get in.",0.5994,0.207,0.716,0.077

Emilia Romagna opened just last night - there were more than a few of us to welcome ER to the Strip with open arms!  A group of us sat around the enormous bar and enjoyed a couple of well-crafted cocktails, a beer or two for a couple of us and a dizzying array of not-your-typical bar food.First, the drinks.  I first sampled an Ultra L that was chocolatey yet light - white chocolate liquor, fresh lemon juice, gin, avocado (makes it smoooooooth!) and Aztec chocolate bitters (just a few of the ingredients)...absolutely delightful!  A friend had the Dirty Blonde which incorporated vodka, olive brine, pineapple and jalapeno and garnished with bleu cheese stuffed olives....only for those who love a really dirty martini....we started calling it the Filthy Blonde! A rosemary lemondrop using rosemary-infused vodka AND rosemary simple syrup with crisp and refreshing!Next, the FOOD!  Do NOT MISS the fried cheese!  Browned and crisp on the outside - not breaded to achieve the crispiness, no, pan seared and browned!  It was topped with arugula, shavings of parm and truffle oil.  It was my favorite bar snack of the night!  The crispy polenta cakes were good, too...maybe needed some shavings of parm and/or a little side of marinara to dip....but still quite nice.  I wasn't able to sample the pasta and meatballs, but my companions RAVED!  Fresh, homemade pasta, mind you!  They also order a pizza with house-made mozzarella and fresh basil...they loved it...especially the mozz.  And they have a sushi bar, too!  Imagine that.  Another of our dining companions enjoyed a sushi selection that even included a quail egg...it was gorgeous.I can't give a complete review for a couple of reasons.  1. The upstairs club area will open the weekend after the 4th of July - I hear great things...including having a see-through floor! 2. The outside Sand Bar that will have SAND and tropical surroundings, steel drums and tropical drinks isn't yet open either...it, too, will open the weekend after the 4th.  3.  I NEED to get there for dinner SOON!  Prime steaks and pasta and seafood abound on the menu!  I spoke with the chef who says their gnocchi is gluten-free!!!!!!

My hubby and I went here for dinner a week after their opening and had an enjoyable experience, despite some kinks that I hope they work out over time.I loved the atmosphere of the dining room. There was a lot of exposed brick, a big wine cellar in the back, and large windows across the front of the building that provided just the right amount of charm and elegance. I enjoyed the background music (think Frank Sinatra), although it was hard to hear over the clubbing music coming from upstairs (will get to that later). All in all though, I felt like the atmosphere transported me far away from Pittsburgh and into a modern day meets old world Italian setting. Perfecto!We started with some refreshing cocktails and the meatballs and caprese salad for appetizers. I wish our server had informed us of how big the meatballs were, they were a meal in and of itself!  That being said, we polished off both appetizers. I highly recommend trying the meatballs - they're some of the best I've ever had!I ordered the canestri dish for my entree and my hubby got the Jameson lamb. My dish consisted of a homemade pasta topped with tender lamb and a delicious vodka red sauce (if you've read my Eleven review, you'd know that I'm not the biggest fan of lamb, but this was so good!). Unfortunately, I'm not sure their canestri dish is the same anymore as it doesn't mention a vodka sauce on their online menu now.  The Jameson lamb was tasty, but I thought the mint was overpowering.  I also thought the gnocchi had a strange texture, but it looks like they don't serve that anymore with the dish, so maybe that wouldn't be an issue. For dessert, we split the cannoli, which was filled with an orange flavored cream. Honestly, I'm not a big fan of orange so I didn't really like the cannoli. I would have loved a chocolate option, but they only had the cannoli or cheesecake. Oh well, next time I'll try the cheesecake! So while we have a lovely time checking out the latest addition to the Strip District, there are a few things I'd love Emilia Romagna to change. One, their bread. It tasted like a day old Giant Eagle loaf. Their olive oil sauce was delicious, so I'd love to see the bread match that! Two, I'd love for them to have a few more menu options. I understand that the restaurant is new, and they'll probably add to their menu as time goes on. I just felt like there were limited options, especially if you don't want meat. Maybe some more pasta options would help? Also, as a side note, my dish came out lukewarm. I should have sent it back but I didn't want to put a damper on our dinner (I know, I know, that's just who I am).  And three, the music. Loved the background music in the restaurant, until it was overpowered by the dance music in the club. I couldn't concentrate on our meal after that! Please please Emilia Romagna, don't play the music so loudly! Or just start an hour or two later. I love me some dance music, but that's not what I want to hear when I'm spending $200 on my dinner. So if you go armed knowing that there may still be some kinks to work out, I think you could still have a great experience. I definitely plan on going back!  I'll be checking out more items on their cocktail list and will be sure to stuff my belly with meatballs galore.",review,0,LAecGqsAdvAuM96sPGQzEA,,"I'm giving Emilia Romagna's three stars but have every intention of going back.

The space is very classic and romantic.  Unfortunately their dimmer was on the fritz so we experienced some odd changes in the lighting.The one thing I would change (or hope the restaurant changes) is the club they have upstairs.  Around 9:00 the bass started thumping and the music became quite intrusive.  Frank Sanatra doesn't go well with dub step bass beats in the background.  Maybe the club shouldn't open until 10:00 or 11:00?  I don't know what the solution is, just the problem.__________Final thoughtsThe food was outstanding.  For that, I'm excited.  There are definitely some kinks from only being open for a short time, but I expect most of them to be worked out soon (and my review to go to 5 stars).I definitely plan on coming back with happy hour serving $5 pizzas and a few $5(maybe) cocktails.

The wait staff are still learning, but they seemed genuine and were very pleasant.  ___________AmbianceAwesome decor with Frank Sanatra type music in the background.  The space is very classic and romantic.  Unfortunately their dimmer was on the fritz so we experienced some odd changes in the lighting.The one thing I would change (or hope the restaurant changes) is the club they have upstairs.  Around 9:00 the bass started thumping and the music became quite intrusive.  Frank Sanatra doesn't go well with dub step bass beats in the background.  Maybe the club shouldn't open until 10:00 or 11:00?  I don't know what the solution is, just the problem.__________Final thoughtsThe food was outstanding.  For that, I'm excited.  There are definitely some kinks from only being open for a short time, but I expect most of them to be worked out soon (and my review to go to 5 stars).I definitely plan on coming back with happy hour serving $5 pizzas and a few $5(maybe) cocktails.  With generous hours of 4-7 M-F on the happy hour, you really have no excuse not to try this place out.",0.7257,0.305,0.606,0.088

The sauce on Conicellas pizza didn't really have any spices in it that I could taste.  Don't confuse it with boring or bland though as the tomatoes brought a brightness to the pie and I enjoyed the slight acidity to them which helped to balance the cheese.  Speaking of the cheese, it had a nice flavor to it and there was an ton of it.  As a matter of a fact, the first piece that I tried to eat had half of it slide off because of its proportion to the thin crust.  Last but not least was the thin crust which I thought was fantastic.  It was super crispy and on the first two pieces that I ate I audibly crunched through each piece.  Then after it sat for a little while the center of the pie became less crunchy while the back was still nice and crisp.  It had a nice flavor too and I think I could taste a little yeastiness in the middle of the crust at the back of the pizza.The bottom line for me is that I will head back to Conicellas again in the future.

Is it still a relevant topic in  the culinary arts? I'll jump the border and cross the Rio Grande if I want tacos from Mexico. If I just want to eat some quality tacos without the need for a passport, I'll cross the Monongahela and head East. This past weekend, after experiencing the Shadyside Arts Festival, Kay and I replenished ourselves at Chica Loca Taco after it captured the corner of my eye several times as we strolled up and down Walnut Street.Nearly stark mad with hunger, I was greeted by an eclectic staff of cheery youngsters and ordered a trio of torridly tantalizing tacos: The Carnitas, The Pescado, and The Cardon.The Pescado was the weightiest of the triad and contained a chunk of fish too large to be tilapia (???) that was dressed with slaw, ""quesa fresca,"" and a sort of ""crema"" or mayonnaise. I found nothing ""dry"" about any of the tacos, from the doubled-up tortilla to all  the vegetables and meats that filled them.

As soon as I saw a brief mention of this place on the talk pages of Yelp Pittsburgh, I monitored their progress towards opening by ""liking"" their page on facebook. It finally opened while I was out of town, so I made it a point to try this place as soon as I got back.  Walking back from school yesterday (Monday), I walked up and realized that they're not open on Mondays.  So I tried again today.The brightly painted walls of this place remind me of a traditional mexican restaurant.  When you first walk in, their gelato lies in a similar position where Mercurio's gelatos used to lie.  From the end of the table, I ordered two tacos to go - one al pastor and the other carnitas.  They offer a number of salsas, and it seems that you can pack your own, even though they initially ask whether you want any one in particular.While i waited, i sampled the mojito gelato (""with real booze""), one of their many interestingly flavors.  It was surprisingly light and tasty, although there were quite a few ice crystals in my sample because the lady scooped from the surface.  I'll most likely try a cup of this the next time I come back; it has just the right lightness that I like for a summer snack/dessert.My order was fulfilled in a reasonable time (there was only one other party that had finished eating already).  I walked home as quickly as I could so that I could enjoy my tacos while they were still warm and so that the juices from the meat wouldn't soak through the corn tortilla.  My only thought on the walk back was, ""I hope they put two corn tortillas, unlike reyna foods...""And there were two corn tortillas!  The tacos aren't fully decked out like the ""super tacos"" of small mexican joints - as seen in the pictures, they provide the meat and some diced onions/cilantro. no lettuce, tomato, or any of that stuff. I asked for a bit of their medium house salsa, which came on the side. it was very mild for my taste (I could barely taste any spicyness), so I'll be trying their next level up next time I go.  The carnitas was slightly dryer than I expected, which eliminated the soggy corn tortilla problem.  The corn tortilla had cooled down, and I think it would have tasted better if left on the griddle slightly longer.  The pineapple on the al pastor taco definitely helped the taste a bit, but like the carnitas, they were just a tad underseasoned.   They put one salsa cup in my bag, which I ran out after 1.5 tacos, which meant that I barely had any salsa for my chips.  So if you get your order to go, make sure you have enough salsa! The chips that were also provided in a small bag was a nice accompaniment to my tacos. Thumbs up for not putting much salt on them. For two tacos my meal came out to be ~7.50, which is high/very high for the standard, but based on location (being in shadyside), I understand their pricing, and I don't have much to complain about.  I hope they'll have those spicy pickled veggies (Carrots, jalapenos, onions etc) soon! those will definitely be a great condiment for the tacos in addition to solely salsa.Based on my review, I may just be accustomed to slightly heavier tastes (more spicyness, more spices).

No dynamics between dishes.  This restaraunt is trying to mimic authentic mexican food, but is failing miserably.  Nonetheless, if you have never experienced real mexican food before, you may still be fooled into thinking they serve good tacos.  Everything they serve ""looks"" just right, but the taste is far from accurate.

A lot of the other reviewers here seem to have experienced similar trepidation, but I guess that says something about the restaurant itself.I fortuitously managed to try Chica Loca on Taco Tuesday(!) and was treated to the super-special deal of 2 tacos for $5, otherwise known as, exactly how much tacos should cost. The chorizo (sourced from Las Palmas in Oakland) taco was really tasty. As noted, they provide the traditional taco format: 2 corn tortillas, lime wedge, topped with cilantro, queso fresco, and diced onion. I got mine with pico de gallo but craved more taste and ended up using extra spicy salsa. The carnitas taco was good, I suppose. Individually, the meat was flavorful and tasty but it got lost in, surprisingly enough, the tortillas. You know there is a problem with your seasoning when it gets overpowered by corn tortillas...The decor is nothing to write home about: chairs and tables that would look normal on a suburban deck, bright wall colors, and a rather bizarre shotgun layout in which the counter is at the far back, requiring you to walk down the 4 foot aisle past other eaters.I feel bad because I love eating tacos and supporting local business but I was not that happy with this place. I tried to order the ""super secret salsa"" as well as the tomatillo salsa and was informed that they were out (this was around 7pm on a weekday). I think the woman I was speaking with was the owner and she was very nice and talkative, encouraging me to return and try the salsas I missed. I probably will go back one day because it was objectively enjoyable food. That said, I would only go back on a tuesday.

We were here last night for dinner and I was a bit disappointed to find Chef Kevin Souza who just arrived here weeks ago has now moved on again to Nine on Nine (3rd move this summer for this talented chef).  The space is very nice.  It is full of deep reds which automatically relax and a nice dining area.  The bar next to the dining area is a little bizarre because the seats are too low to the ground and force you to feel like your sitting at the kiddies table with you barely able to put your elbows on the bar.  I asked about the ackward seating and was told it has to do with them buying a bar that was too tall and insurance issues on getting properly fitted seating.  They have great big leather seats for lounging with your cocktails which are a nice touch.  They've also recently added outdoor and rooftop seating which is great on a warm autumn day.  The service was a little below average.  We had a very unenthusiastic chap named Mick who didn't commit any major faux pas, but it was clear this was not were he wanted to be.  The wine selection is okay.  They have a few more expensive interesting options, but the waiter didn't offer any suggestions or seemed trained at all on the description of the bottles.  The bread was okay. I'm guessing breadworks bread served with this interesting pomogranite and onion butter.  The flavors worked okay for the butter, but I would have been more pleased if the butter and bread were served warm.  I ordered the salmon tartare which had a nice flavor seasoned with cilantro and mango, however the fish itself was a little warmer than room temperature.  This is not good for tartare. It should be served slightly chilled.  Fiona had the scallop appetizer which was served on this extremely bland breadcrumb type pancake.  The scallop itself was delicious and cooked perfectly however for $12 I think one deserves more than one average sized scallop.  I had the lamb chops which were cooked perfectly and very flavorful, however the greens that accompanied were bland.  They don't put salt and pepper on the tables which is okay and I've been to other fine dining where this occurs.  However, if they won't provide the flavor enhancers they should be spot on with the seasoning.  Red room is not.  Fiona had the strip steak which was $42. This seems a bit much for strip.  It was very fatty and had a weird chemical flavor. I'm guessing from a charcoal bricket.  It was edible, but I've had better steaks at TGIF.  We skipped dessert.  The bill including tip was $180.  This place is overpriced for the quality of food and serving size.  I'd be okay paying this cost if I was trying something unique like I was hoping for with Chef Souza, however they have re employed an old sous chef who is now doing the cooking and in my opinion does not justify the cost.

We were able to watch the fireworks from our comfortable window table without all of the craziness that is Mount Washington on the fourth of July. The view was spectacular! The restaurant is small and intimate. This allowed for a quiet and cozy atmosphere rather than the larger Mt. Wash restaurants. Now on to the food.The menu, which is largly verbal, consists of various steak and seafood entrees. The rest of the five courses are predetermined with the exception of the first course where you choose the soup du jour or seasonal fruit. The menu also does not have prices so be aware that the entrees rang from 50-70$. I started with the wedding soup. It was a traditional wedding soup with a small piece of garlic bread. The next course consists of a large vegetable boat with clam dip for the table to share. Raw vegetables, olives, stuffed grape leaves and marinated artichokes. I was not impressed. It seemed like something you would serve at a nice family cookout. For my entree, I chose the filet with sauteed mushrooms. The filet was cooked to perfection and melt in your mouth tender. One of the best filet's I have ever had. Dinner entrees were served with garlic toast and rice pilaf with pine nuts. The garlic toast was super yummy. I even grabbed a piece of hubs while we watched the fireworks. Dinner service was put on hold during the fireworks. So we waited and waited for our empty entree dishes to be cleared. My dining companions didn't seem to mind but I was in a bit of a rush to leave because of our babysitter. We had been at TA for 2 hours by that point and we still had to order dessert! Dinner service is rather slo in general even without the fireworks. They seem to want you to sit back, relax and enjoy the view. When the waitress finally came around for dessert orders, I ordered the TA parfait with vanilla ice cream and a berry liqueur.

I passed on this as I couldn't fit another bite. The biggest issue of the night came when we were presented with the check. Because the courses are predetermined, the check consisted of 4 entrees and 1 glass of wine. We asked the waitress to split the check by couple and we explained what each person received. After a good five minutes she came back with two checks that were completely wrong. There were entrees on there that we didn't even order. We tried to explain it but my dinning companion had to go over with the waitress and tell her what each of us ordered. After another ten minutes we finally got the correct checks.

Then it gets akward...there are 2 tables which came in after us, probably a good 20 minutes (or more) after we sat down.

YES they did!

While the seasoning sitting on top of the tofu was decent, the tofu itself was not good.  I enjoy tofu but I like the firm tofu and it has to be cooked the right way.  But this was the super soft tofu that had an unpleasant texture and nonexistent taste.  I did not finish it.  That being said, I added an extra star b/c I ordered the wrong thing.  I really feel like this was a 2 star experience.  There are two parts to the dining experience, food and the service.

Great ramen has a very fragrant and savory broth that is not too salty; on this occasion this broth was WAY too salty. Either they added too much soy sauce or too much salt.

We were there for a ""Moon"" celebration, but wished to try the food out while we where there. The d̩cor is eclectic, but gives you a bit of a homey feeling. I tried three different appetizers. One was the fried cauliflower which was fantastic! I also tried the falafel , which was good and came with a dipping sauce that to me had a small bite to it, although my friend said she did not notice that. I also had the ground meat in Filo, which were delightful little pastries. The Fenugreek tea was awesome, and they made sure we didn't run out. My friend had a chicken dish which I sampled. This was delightful, and the plate made a beautiful presentation, what with the very green fresh broccoli, red peppers, and the seared chicken. It tasted pretty darn good too! If your adventurous, definitely try this place out, but don't go there expecting to see American Items on the menu. This is strictly a place for a very different type of cuisine in the Burgh! One I was very happy to try out, and was very happy I did. The service is a little spotty, but there was a large party in the other room, and then a party of four came into the dining room where we were. I commend these folks for their brave and adventurous undertaking. Brookline needs good places to go to , and this is definitely one of them. I will go back . I must mention also the music.

We were there for a ""Moon"" celebration, but wished to try the food out while we where there. The d̩cor is eclectic, but gives you a bit of a homey feeling. I tried three different appetizers. One was the fried cauliflower which was fantastic! I also tried the falafel , which was good and came with a dipping sauce that to me had a small bite to it, although my friend said she did not notice that. I also had the ground meat in Filo, which were delightful little pastries. The Fenugreek tea was awesome, and they made sure we didn't run out. My friend had a chicken dish which I sampled. This was delightful, and the plate made a beautiful presentation, what with the very green fresh broccoli, red peppers, and the seared chicken. It tasted pretty darn good too! If your adventurous, definitely try this place out, but don't go there expecting to see American Items on the menu. This is strictly a place for a very different type of cuisine in the Burgh! One I was very happy to try out, and was very happy I did. The service is a little spotty, but there was a large party in the other room, and then a party of four came into the dining room where we were. I commend these folks for their brave and adventurous undertaking. Brookline needs good places to go to , and this is definitely one of them. I will go back . I must mention also the music.

Seeing as Italian is one of my absolute favorite cuisines, I have a slight bias towards Italian restaurants.I ordered the Ravioli of the Day, which consisted of Sweet Potato and Goat Cheese Ravioli in a light butter sauce topped with walnuts. (Sounds absolutely divine, right?) Upon first bite, I thought the dish was DELICIOUS. After the third, I was completely and utterly sick of it. In hindsight, I realize the sweet potato was TOO sweet and totally overpowered the sourness of the goat cheese and richness of the butter sauce. The walnut topping definitely helped balance out the sweetness, but it was still too much. I could barely get through 5 bites before my taste buds conceded defeat.My companion diners seemed to enjoy their dishes, but perhaps it was due to their ordering simpler menu items (gnocchi with alfredo sauce) or choosing dishes that are typically on their menu every day. I'm guessing it might be the latter, since sweet potato seems to be more of an autumnal menu item.Aside from the food, the ambiance was pleasant and ""romantic"" and the service was decent (nothing atrocious, but also nothing to write home about).

There are several options for vegetarians, but most involve requesting meat to be removed from a menu item.  Lunch and dinner have different menus (no eggplant on the lunch menu), so check online before you go.  Bread and olive oil with crushed pepper is served complimentary and refilled upon request.  The last time we went, we tried the mushroom bruschetta, which was very tasty.  Salads can be added to meals for an additional charge and they come with the house dressing, which is surprisingly bland.  The spicy pappardelle (sans sausage) was good but not great, but was spicy, as advertised.  We haven't tried desert yet.  The one time we intended to order desert, wait staff issues prevented it from happening (see below).  An entree is enough to fill you up, but there won't be extra to take home like most Pittsburgh Italian restaurants.  Without ordering the additional side salad, you may leave hungry, which seems to contradict the cardinal rule of Italian dining.Price: Appetizers range from $9-15 with entrees ranging from $12-$28.  Lunch is slightly cheaper than dinner, but not by much.  Four of us ordered a single appetizer to share, two side salads, and four entrees for a grand total of nearly $100 with tip; not cheap for lunch.Drinks: Pizzutti's is BYOB.
